        ### üìë Patch name and description
        The name of the patch is essential as it determines the filename of the VDF and the directory tree, and prefixes all script symbol names. The patch description serves as basic information for players visible in the ingame console and inside the VDF. The name can only consist of alpha numerical characters (including underscore) without a leading digit.

        > [!Note]
        > The <i>name</i> and <i>description</i> of the patch will be taken from this repository's name and description (from the repository details), respectively. For example, if your GitHub repository is <kbd>user/Patch123</kbd>, the patch name will be <kbd>Patch123</kbd>.
        > If you want to change the name or description of the repository, please do so before you continue.

        ### üß∞ Resources

        A patch can change various resources (e.g. menu scripts, output units, etc., see documentation). Here, you will select which resources your patch will modify. By default, patches are compatible with <kbd>Gothic</kbd>, <kbd>Gothic Sequel</kbd>, <kbd>Gothic 2</kbd>, and <kbd>Gothic 2 NotR</kbd>. Each resource, you can modify for some, all or none of the games. The patch files will be created with a corresponding game-specific suffix or a single file is created with no suffix if all games are selected.

        If you have any questions, do not hesitate to discuss them [here](https://github.com/szapp/patch-template/discussions).

        ## üé® Content scripts

        The content scripts entail everything from NPCs and items to story, events, and some aspects of AI and gameplay mechanics. Because the scripts differ the most between the four different games. They will always come as separate source files (SRC) for each.
